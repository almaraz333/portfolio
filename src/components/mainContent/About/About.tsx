      <p>
        I have a passion for code. Being able to analyze a problem, implementing
        a solution, while still being able to be creative is what I love. Being
        someone who strives to always be doing something productive, having the
        skills to create amazing experiences allows me to fulfill that goal.
        Along with coding another passion of mine is space. Everything related
        to our universe completely fascinates me. One of my life goals is to
        some day be able to go into space and view Earth from there.
