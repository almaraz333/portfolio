        Hey! I'm Colton Almaraz and I'm a software developer. I make digital
        spaces for everyone and everything.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm a mostly remote dev who creates minimal, effective products and
        sometimes has a hand in designing them. Whether it's mockups,
        prototypes, back-end, or front-end I have the skills required to create
        and experience the user will never forget. I focus on products from a
        human perspective as well as business.
